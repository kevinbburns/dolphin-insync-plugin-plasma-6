# Insync Dolphin plugin

This is a forked version from the upstream: https://github.com/insynchq/dolphin-insync-plugin because for a long time it would not work with Plasma 6. Upstream came up with their own solutions instead of using this version. This version contains more fixes for crashes (the plugin used to crash Dolphin when a menu was opened for a file that was being uploaded - but that was fixed in Qt 6). This version has better install and uninstall routines and bundles the necessary icons. It is probably technically superior, has more thorough README, but functionally it does not make much difference which one you use.

Insync context menus and overlay icons use the KDE6 API and will not work in KDE5 and earlier.

### Context menus
Insync context menus are implemented using the KDE API [KAbstractFileItemActionPlugin]. The `KAbstractFileItemActionPlugin:actions` is called whenever a user right-clicks on a file or directory and should return a list of `QAction`s. If this returns an empty list, no additional context menus are added. This `QAction`s listed are always appended to the default list of options in the context menu. In our implementation, we return a [KActionMenu] containing the list of `QAction`s (`Add to Insync`, `Share`, etc) so that all of our context menu options are containined in its own submenu. Right now, we only support context menu actions when a single file/directory is selected as the client doesn't support it yet. A `.desktop` KDE service file is needed for this to show up in the list of plugins a user can enable in the Dolphin settings.


### Overlay icons
Insync file overlay status icons are implemented using [KOverlayIconPlugin]. The `KOverlayIconPlugin:getOverlays` is called on every file/directory currently showing in Dolphin. Since it is called on every file/directory, we create a new `QLocalSocket` on every call as it can cause segfaults if there are too many files/directories being queried. The build library file for this is added to the `KDE_PLUGIN_DIR/kf5/overlayicon` folder and it should work without needing a KDE service file.


### Helper library
We have an additional library `InsyncDolphinPluginHelper` that's used in both the context menu and overlay icon libraries for doing common functions (connecting to `insync.sock`, sending/receiving commands to the `insync.sock`, etc).

### Dependencies
On Fedora, you need at least these:
```
sudo dnf install kf6-kcoreaddons-devel kf6-kio-devel kf6-kconfig-devel extra-cmake-modules qt6-qtbase-devel g++
```
On Kubuntu (and possibly Ubuntu and Debian), you need at least these:
```
sudo apt install kf6-kcoreaddons-dev kf6-kio-dev kf6-kconfig-dev extra-cmake-modules qt6-base-dev g++ cmake
```
### Build
```
git clone https://github.com/felagund/dolphin-insync-plugin-plasma-6.git
rm build # not necessary unless you previously compiled the plugin
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -B build/
cmake --build build/
```
### Install

```
sudo cmake --install build
```

Note that everything is installed into `/usr`, not `/usr/local`(which does not work).

### Uninstall
```
sudo rm /usr/lib64/libinsyncdolphinpluginhelper.so /usr/lib64/qt6/plugins/kf6/kfileitemaction/insyncfileitemaction.so /usr/lib64/qt6/plugins/kf6/overlayicon/insyncoverlayicon.so /usr/share/icons/hicolor/64x64/emblems/emblem-insync-* /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems/emblem-insync-* ; sudo rmdir /usr/share/icons/hicolor/64x64/emblems /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/emblems

```
In case this throws an error, note where the files you are trying to remove are placed during the installation and remove those.
